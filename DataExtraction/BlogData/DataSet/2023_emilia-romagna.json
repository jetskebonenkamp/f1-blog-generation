DC was a bit of a Monaco Master, taking McLaren's only win of 2002 on the streets after previously storming to the top of the podium in 2000.

Max Verstappen snaring pole isn't an entirely unexpected eventuality in 2023 given the dominance of his Red Bull package, but yesterday's run to the top spot was utterly captivating.
