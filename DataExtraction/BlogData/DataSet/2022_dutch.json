Easy.", "2022-09-04T13:37:44Z": "The biggest winner in the first round of pitstops was definitely Alonso, as he's popped up to ninth place ahead of Alpine team-mate Ocon. Both are on the hards aiming to get the finish on those tyres.", "2022-09-04T13:37:20Z": "And Verstappen is, indeed, eking up on Russell, with the gap at about a second.

He's looking to get ahead of the Mercedes duo when they eventually stop.", "2022-09-04T13:27:19Z": "McLaren rather show Ferrari how to do it with a speedy 2.4s pitstop for Norris. The Brit comes out directly behind Sainz and is on the hards, so it looks like he's one-stopping.", "2022-09-04T13:27:20Z": "Verstappen pits from the lead, grabs the medium compound and heads out. Hamilton takes the lead for the time being.", "2022-09-04T13:26:08Z": "Sainz is up to eighth after a couple of drivers pit ahead of him but he's currently 42.2s off the leaders - who are yet to pit - but he's a long way back.", "2022-09-04T13:26:06Z": "Leclerc comes in to stop from second.

That'll be a clearcut thing, so it looks like he'll be in trouble.", "2022-09-04T13:22:41Z": "Sainz comes in to pit from third place, grabbing a set of mediums - but it's a slow stop! Sainz loses well over 10s there and drops to 11th. Perez also pitted at the same time and comes out ahead.", "2022-09-04T13:21:49Z": "Schumacher endured a painfully long pitstop, 10s stationary, and comes out in 17th behind Zhou. That's potentially wrecked his race and fight for points.", "2022-09-04T13:20:47Z": "Zhou also pits, to come out in 18th behind Gasly but ahead of Vettel.", "2022-09-04T13:20:13Z": "Further ahead Alonso charges by the other AlphaTauri of Tsunoda at Turn 1 to take 11th place, but then pits at the end of the lap to cycle back through the pack.", "2022-09-04T13:18:52Z": "Gasly and Ricciardo respond to Vettel's early stop by pitting a lap later. But it is too late for Ricciardo, as Vettel has pulled off the undercut on him.", "2022-09-04T13:17:56Z": "Vettel is the early pitter, taking his first stop at the end of lap 11. He has gone from the softs to the mediums.", "2022-09-04T13:15:56Z": "But just like that, Alonso proves us wrong as he uses DRS to fly by Gasly into Turn 1 to take 12th place.", "2022-09-04T13:15:10Z": "Due to the tight, twisty and narrow nature of the circuit, there isn't too much early movers while everyone also has tyre wear protection to think about at this point in the race.", "2022-09-04T13:13:08Z": "Leclerc does a 1m16.213s on lap 6, just to try and get back into the one-second bracket behind Verstappen. But Verstappen responds to try and forge a strong lead.", "2022-09-04T13:12:28Z": "After his early salvo into the top six, Norris is keeping clear of Stroll in the battle for seventh.

Let's go!", "2022-09-04T13:01:01Z": "The overcastness and the ferris wheel in the background puts one more in mind of Suzuka rather than Zandvoort.
