It is getting a bit silly now.", "2021-11-07T20:40:00Z": "Perez is cutting the gap to Hamilton once again, and the gap is down to 0.9s with two laps to go.", "2021-11-07T20:39:41Z": "Bottas, on said soft tyres, has un-lapped himself by passing Verstappen but is now being caught again by the race leader and duly being shown blue flags.

Hot under the collar down at Mercedes.", "2021-11-07T20:32:34Z": "Further back Bottas has drifted to 4s behind Ricciardo, while the Australian driver is over 2s off Giovinazzi.
