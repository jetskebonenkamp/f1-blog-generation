Ferrari team-mate Leclerc is next up, three seconds ahead.", "2023-09-24T05:41:51Z": "Alonso doesn't stay P7 for long. Fellow Spaniard Sainz gets a better drive out of Turn 11 and moves ahead. Next up, Ocon.", "2023-09-24T05:41:48Z": "In the shakeout of the pitstops, Piastri was indeed able to jump Norris. He holds a 4.5s margin over his McLaren team-mate and is P3, soon to be P2 when Russell pits.", "2023-09-24T05:41:10Z": "Alonso sits P7 and is all over the back of his old team-mate Ocon ahead. The Alpine driver is on the hard tyre having pitted at the end of lap one.", "2023-09-24T05:39:42Z": "Russell assumes the lead of the Japanese GP as Sainz pits.

Hamilton runs wide again at Spoon and forces his team-mate off the track. There is a real chance the stewards will take a dim view on that one.", "2023-09-24T05:33:38Z": "Perez has been told to retire the car, somewhat ironically as he is handed another penalty for his collision with Magnussen. A nightmare race for the Red Bull driver which is in stark comparison to his team-mate.", "2023-09-24T05:32:33Z": "The new order is Verstappen, Norris, Leclerc, Sainz and Hamilton. Verstappen's lead is 9.1s.", "2023-09-24T05:31:58Z": "The VSC has ended before the leaders have managed to get back around to the pits. The full benefit of this will become clear in time.", "2023-09-24T05:30:58Z": "As Piastri stops, the VSC comes out to allow for debris from the Perez-Magnussen incident to be cleared. This could be perfect timing for the Australian if this lasts for less than a lap.", "2023-09-24T05:30:12Z": "Piastri pits from P3. Mediums off and hards on.", "2023-09-24T05:28:51Z": "You can't help but get the feeling another penalty might be heading Perez's way after that collision. Both drivers have headed to the pits.", "2023-09-24T05:28:28Z": "Oh dear. Perez looks to the inside of Magnussen into Turn 11 and the pair make contact. The Haas driver is sent spinning and Perez has damaged his front wing.", "2023-09-24T05:27:36Z": "The undercut is expected to be extremely powerful today, so Alonso's stop covers the threat from Hamilton behind.", "2023-09-24T05:27:04Z": "Alonso is another to come in from P6, and the Spaniard has the hard tyre fitted to his Aston Martin.", "2023-09-24T05:26:21Z": "Lawson, who had been running ninth on softs, has pitted. The first signs that we're in for at least a two-stop race, if not three, with only 10 laps completed.", "2023-09-24T05:25:42Z": "Onto lap 10 and the gaps continue to grow at the front. Verstappen leads by 3.7s from Norris and, as things stand, Red Bull will be confirmed as the constructors' champions.", "2023-09-24T05:25:15Z": "The Red Bull driver did drop back, but obviously the stewards deemed his actions worthy of a 5s penalty.", "2023-09-24T05:24:39Z": "The penalties are coming thick and fast. This time for Perez for a safety car infringement when the Mexican overtook several cars on the exit of the pitlane.", "2023-09-24T05:23:13Z": "Our first penalty of the race and it's a five-second one for Sargeant for causing that collision with Bottas. And speaking of the Alfa driver, he's parked it in the garage and his grim day is over already.", "2023-09-24T05:21:55Z": "Home hero Tsunoda is currently running in 10th, but has Stroll keeping him honest behind - both of them currently on the soft tyre.", "2023-09-24T05:20:56Z": "No further investigation on all the lap one carnage.", "2023-09-24T05:20:23Z": "Expectations in the lead-up to the race were that there would be little to separate the soft and medium tyres in terms of life. The top five are on mediums with Alonso, P6, on softs. We'll now see how accurate these forecasts were.", "2023-09-24T05:19:57Z": "The incident between Bottas and Sargeant is unsurprisingly under investigation. Both have made a second stop and we're only on lap 7!", "2023-09-24T05:18:30Z": "At the front and with DRS now enabled, Verstappen is now two-seconds clear of Norris. Piastri has also dropped back on his team-mate by a similar margin.", "2023-09-24T05:18:27Z": "Replays show Bottas tried to go around the outside of Sargeant and the pair make heavy contact. Their days are just going from bad to worse.", "2023-09-24T05:16:52Z": "More drama for Bottas as he goes off at Turn 11. The Finn comes over the radio and is not happy, so possibly he was helped off.", "2023-09-24T05:16:30Z": "A considerably calmer restart than the original getaway. The early interruption will certainly have caused chaos with some pit strategies.", "2023-09-24T05:15:01Z": "Verstappen holds the pack back as he creeps around 130R. Into the final chicane, he pins the throttle and we are racing once more!", "2023-09-24T05:13:17Z": "The safety car will return to the pits at the end of this lap - lap 4.", "2023-09-24T05:12:51Z": "Incredibly despite all the mayhem, all 20 drivers are currently still running... for now at least.", "2023-09-24T05:11:54Z": "That was all rather chaotic at the start. Clearly, the drivers have been taking lessons from MotoGP riders on how not to make it around Turn 1!", "2023-09-24T05:11:01Z": "Perez is another to enter the pits from seventh to replace his front wing, the Red Bull driver having made contact with Hamilton down into Turn 1. The Mexican rejoins at the back of the pack.", "2023-09-24T05:10:00Z": "All the incidents at lap one, Turn 1 have been noted by race control.", "2023-09-24T05:09:49Z": "Ooofff! Replays of the start show Albon went airborne briefly after contact with Bottas down into Turn 1. Incredibly though, the Williams driver is back out behind the safety car.", "2023-09-24T05:09:19Z": "A slow start for Leclerc was the spark that caused the chaos further back, as Sainz was forced to take avoiding action. This made him squeeze Perez, who in turn hit Hamilton off the track.", "2023-09-24T05:07:50Z": "He's not the only one to come into the pits, as Albon, team-mate Zhou and Ocon also come in.", "2023-09-24T05:07:49Z": "Looking back to the start, Verstappen goes ultra-defensive on Piastri, pulling across but leaving the door open to Norris, who took the space and attempted a bold move around the outside of turns one and two.", "2023-09-24T05:06:48Z": "It's Bottas. The Finn has damaged his front wing and has a right front puncture which will require a trip to the pits.", "2023-09-24T05:06:27Z": "Leclerc and Sainz follow the leaders but the safety car is out already to allow debris from the start to be cleared.", "2023-09-24T05:05:50Z": "There's contact down the back of the field with the rush into Turn 1, as one of the Alfa Romeo drivers has picked up damage.", "2023-09-24T05:05:12Z": "Piastri, Norris and Verstappen go wheel-to-wheel but the Red Bull driver retains his advantage as Piastri drops back to P3.", "2023-09-24T05:04:39Z": "WE ARE RACING!", "2023-09-24T05:04:25Z": "Verstappen and Piastri are nicely angled in at each other on the grid. This could be spicy!", "2023-09-24T05:03:26Z": "At the final corner and only now does Verstappen begin to back the pack up. But even then, Piastri drops further back.
