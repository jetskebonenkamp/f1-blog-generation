Stroll, despite his wrist break, finishes in sixth place from Russell.", "2023-03-05T16:39:41Z": "Ah, that's why Zhou pitted late on. He went for the fastest lap of the race which takes it off Gasly in the Alpine, but he doesn't pick it up himself as he finished outside of the top 10.

It does the trick as he sets the fastest lap of the race while running in 18th on the hard tyres. Which is unusual.", "2023-03-05T15:51:57Z": "Norris pits again for the latest engine top up, which puts him back to 19th place.

Painful.", "2023-03-05T15:50:56Z": "Hamilton's now been encouraged to pick up the pace, and has reopened the gap to Alonso slightly to two seconds. Alonso, in response, has elected to push Hamilton a bit more.", "2023-03-05T15:50:25Z": "Oh Esteban, it is not your night. Ocon has been given ANOTHER penalty, this time for speeding in the pitlane.

Double trouble incoming?", "2023-03-05T15:35:06Z": "Norris returns to the action but is down in last place.

The timing graphics show Verstappen on the hards, so we've potentially got that wrong.", "2023-03-05T15:33:29Z": "It is double disaster for McLaren, as Norris pits for the second time due to an pneumatic issue with his engine.", "2023-03-05T15:30:57Z": "Ocon pits to serve his penalty and also take on a new front wing. That puts him 19th and last.", "2023-03-05T15:30:42Z": "Stroll's in from third now, and collects the hard tyre.

Nice work from the Alfa squad there.", "2023-03-05T15:28:58Z": "Meanwhile, the stewards have investigated Ocon and given him a five-second penalty for not being in the correct grid position at the start. He's also carrying front wing damage to add more woes to his night.", "2023-03-05T15:28:23Z": "Verstappen comes in to stop from the lead, and takes a second set of soft tyres to break with the prevailing trend. Alonso comes in to box too, taking hard tyres for this next stint.", "2023-03-05T15:27:10Z": "Leclerc pits, and collects the hard tyres. Sainz manages to come in on the same lap, and also grabs the white-walled compound. Russell follows suit, and is a little slow away.", "2023-03-05T15:25:30Z": "Hamilton pits from fifth place as he was flagging on his softs, as Alonso gives it good guns on Russell.
