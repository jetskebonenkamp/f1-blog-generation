Welcome gifts for those two given their recent form.", "2020-10-25T13:41:54Z": "Bottas tried the pocketsand method of defense, but Hamilton was too quick and was able to rub any off-line dirt out of his eyes.", "2020-10-25T13:41:01Z": "Hamilton clears Bottas to take the lead! The British driver is a lot quicker, gets the momentum in the final corner and gets clear with DRS.", "2020-10-25T13:40:21Z": "Both Norris and Stroll pit after that contact and both have been placed under investigation for the incident.", "2020-10-25T13:39:40Z": "Not a good moment for Stroll. The Racing Point driver had been hounding Norris for seventh place but a half-move around the outside at Turn 1 sees him clip the McLaren driver and get into a spin.

We see you.", "2020-10-25T13:34:24Z": "Ricciardo pits as expected to get rid of his softs for new mediums and returns in 19th place.

He's also got the fastest lap so far.", "2020-10-25T13:30:58Z": "Raikkonen duly pits at the end of lap 11 to trade his softs for a new set of mediums.

Gasly is the benefactor this time to take eighth place.", "2020-10-25T13:29:21Z": "Leclerc's now right on Sainz's tail. They'll be team-mates next year, and Sainz might now wish he was in that Ferrari as it seems to have a splash of pace.", "2020-10-25T13:28:34Z": "Stroll has been shown the black and white flag on lap 10. He's been crossing those track limits quite often and the rules are if any driver does it more than three times they get shown said flag. If he continues that trend he'll be in trouble with the race stewards.", "2020-10-25T13:26:49Z": "Leclerc now steams past Norris, calm as you like with the DRS. Fifth place is his reward for that, and Norris doesn't have the pace to stay with him.", "2020-10-25T13:26:13Z": "Normality is returning to the F1 pecking order, as a lap later Raikkonen loses seventh place to Ricciardo using the DRS to power around the outside of the Alfa Romeo in the charge down to Turn 1.", "2020-10-25T13:24:55Z": "And indeed, Verstappen deploys DRS to clear Sainz and grab third.

That gives Leclerc enough encouragement to get past Raikkonen with the aid of DRS at Turn 1 to take sixth place off the Finn.", "2020-10-25T13:23:33Z": "Hamilton has cleared Sainz too, and it shouldn't be long for Verstappen to get past either as Sainz is struggling with tyre performance now.", "2020-10-25T13:22:11Z": "And Bottas re-passes Sainz to retake the lead! Sainz is now holding Hamilton, as Verstappen was rapid on the previous lap to join this battle.", "2020-10-25T13:21:56Z": "The race stewards have decided no investigation will be necessary for the clash between Perez and Verstappen. Not sure Racing Point will agree.", "2020-10-25T13:20:44Z": "Bottas has now got the tyres up to temperature, posting a 1m23.195 to close in on Sainz. Verstappen has now passed Norris too.", "2020-10-25T13:20:03Z": "Kvyat has also had a nightmare start to this race as drops to 19th place. In summary, those with grip in these early laps are flying and those without, well, are not.", "2020-10-25T13:19:30Z": "Another fastest lap for Sainz, who's keeping a DRS-sized gap to Bottas.
