Maybe.", "2022-09-11T14:17:22Z": "Verstappen gets the tyre news from the cars behind - scrubbed softs for Leclerc and Russell, and new softs for Sainz.", "2022-09-11T14:17:00Z": "Ricciardo's stranded McLaren is being attended to by the track marshals but it appears to be stuck in gear, or at least not moving freely, so this safety car could last a while. It could even mark the end of the race.", "2022-09-11T14:15:11Z": "With Ricciardo dropping out it has promoted Gasly into eighth, de Vries into ninth and Zhou into 10th.", "2022-09-11T14:13:06Z": "Verstappen and Leclerc do not stop, but Russell and Sainz do.

He's out of the race and will that need a safety car?", "2022-09-11T14:11:00Z": "De Vries is also wise to the tricks of the F1 trade because while Verstappen was lapping him and Zhou he's managed to break out of DRS range of the Chinese driver - while getting into DRS himself from Gasly ahead.", "2022-09-11T14:08:38Z": "The de Vries vs Zhou battle for the final points position is temporarily paused as Verstappen comes through to lap the pair. De Vries has done a thoroughly impressive job so far.", "2022-09-11T14:06:39Z": "Perez comes in from fifth place, dropping to seventh behind Hamilton and Norris.

It's not enough to get a win here at this rate.", "2022-09-11T14:04:45Z": "Schumacher locks up under braking at Turn 1 but gets the move done on Latifi for 14th, only for the Williams to fight back around Curva Grande. Schumacher makes it 2-1 into Lesmo 1 and that appears to decide it.", "2022-09-11T14:02:50Z": "Stroll becomes the third retirement in this race as he's told to pit and stop the car. That's a couple DNF for Aston Martin today.", "2022-09-11T14:01:57Z": "The fight for the bottom end of the points has a lot at stake.

That slow 5.1s pitstop drops Norris right into the DRS train and he loses places to Ricciardo, Gasly and Hamilton. What's more the Merc catches Gasly napping and gets up to seventh.", "2022-09-11T13:56:29Z": "Just the small matter of a 19.5s lead for Leclerc to close down on those soft boots.

Hamilton gets ahead of Zhou after one lap and is up to 11th.

That's it for the Alpine driver.", "2022-09-11T13:48:38Z": "Well, there we go - Sainz comes in at the end of lap 30. And it's a set of softs for the Spanish driver.

Hard tyres for the both of them.", "2022-09-11T13:30:06Z": "On lap 18 Norris gets back ahead of Alonso to regain seventh place, using DRS and then diving up the inside at Turn 1.", "2022-09-11T13:29:28Z": "It's a 1m25.145s for Leclerc, who is closing in on Russell and Verstappen slightly as of the end of lap 17.", "2022-09-11T13:28:49Z": "The stewards have done their deliberating and decided to give Magnussen a five-second penalty for his first corner cutting exploits. He's 16th and not going that quickly, so that'll wreck his hopes for points.", "2022-09-11T13:27:17Z": "Latifi pits for Williams and also makes the switch to the hard tyres, coming out behind Perez in 19th.", "2022-09-11T13:26:23Z": "Perez is the hard tyre guiena pig this weekend, and his pace in clean air is matching the current pace of the likes of Russell and Sainz.", "2022-09-11T13:25:07Z": "Ricciardo is at risk of losing further places - Gasly gets past briefly, but clunks over the Turn 1 kerb and has to give back fifth at the start of lap 14.", "2022-09-11T13:24:17Z": "Norris isn't having a great time of things. He runs off track at the first corner and that drops him behind Alonso and into eighth place.", "2022-09-11T13:23:49Z": "It was kind of a half-VSC pitstop there for Leclerc, as Sainz bolts past Ricciardo for fourth at Ascari.", "2022-09-11T13:23:10Z": "A first corner incident involving Magnussen - leaving the track and gaining an advantage - is under investigation with the stewards.", "2022-09-11T13:22:50Z": "Leclerc comes in to stop, picking up the mediums - just as the virtual safety car ends! It's a slightly cheaper pitstop, and Leclerc just stays ahead of Ricciardo. That was tight.", "2022-09-11T13:21:04Z": "Sainz nips past Gasly, moments before a virtual safety car is called. Good timing from the Ferrari driver, who's up to P5.", "2022-09-11T13:21:05Z": "The Virtual Safety Car has been called so the track marshals can rescue Vettel's stranded Aston safely. All drivers have just gone by the pitlane so, at the moment, nobody is able to take a cheap pitstop. Yet.", "2022-09-11T13:20:09Z": "Vettel reports he is losing power - and he is out of this race! He's pulled over to the side of the track and that's his afternoon over.", "2022-09-11T13:18:53Z": "Sainz must be getting a few tenths per lap from the power of the tifosi! He's already up to sixth place, getting by Norris into Turn 1.", "2022-09-11T13:18:00Z": "Perez is asked to move his brake bias to the rear by Red Bull in order to protect his fronts while trying to use cool air to put out the fire on his front-right.

Ricciardo, Gasly and Norris will soon have Sainz to worry about.", "2022-09-11T13:15:11Z": "At the end of lap seven, Perez pits to ditch his mediums for fresh hards. He exits the pits with a smoking brake - that's on fire!", "2022-09-11T13:15:00Z": "Verstappen now turns up the wick and does a 1m25.297s - about 0.2s quicker than Leclerc at the end of lap 7.", "2022-09-11T13:14:00Z": "Perez is trying to follow Sainz still, but is making slower progress.

Behind Russell, the DRS Express is forming with Ricciardo at the front.", "2022-09-11T13:12:08Z": "Sainz, meanwhile, isn't hanging about. He's already 10th on lap six having got by both Aston Martins and Ocon. That Ferrari is flying.", "2022-09-11T13:11:15Z": "Hamilton is making slower progress from the back, just as he had predicted earlier in the weekend, as he gets by Schumacher for 18th. How long until he flicks on Game of Thrones?", "2022-09-11T13:10:25Z": "Verstappen posts a 1m25.782s at the end of lap 4, and gets an excellent tow from Russell - diving down the inside for Turn 1 and grabs second!", "2022-09-11T13:09:54Z": "Having got by Perez on the second lap, Sainz is leading the Mexican driver through the midfield. Both are already clear of Latifi and Magnussen and up to 13th and 14th respectively.", "2022-09-11T13:08:52Z": "Replays of the start show a bit of bumping and grinding at Turn 1 involving Schumacher and Bottas. Later on in the first lap Bottas lost some bodywork which was collected by Hamilton directly behind him.", "2022-09-11T13:08:13Z": "Replay there of Norris' slow start - just gets bogged down on the initial clutch drop. He's got back up to sixth after clearing Fernando Alonso.", "2022-09-11T13:06:37Z": "The back of the grid party sees Sainz up to 15th, fighting Perez through Curva Grande on the second lap.
