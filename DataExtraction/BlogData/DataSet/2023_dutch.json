It sounds about the right time for some more rain to fall...", "2023-08-27T13:21:55Z": "A lap later Perez follows the others and pits for soft tyres. But it is too late, Verstappen pulls off an easy undercut and is now back into the lead.", "2023-08-27T13:20:40Z": "Gasly, from third, duly follows Verstappen into the pits for soft tyres. Now it is just Perez still on the inter tyres.", "2023-08-27T13:19:46Z": "At the end of lap 11 Verstappen pits from second place having got the gap to Perez down to 2.7s.", "2023-08-27T13:18:57Z": "More rain is forecast to hit in a few minutes but because of the speed of Piastri, drivers are gambling on a few fast laps on slicks!", "2023-08-27T13:18:45Z": "There is a threat of rain returning but now the switch back to soft tyres has begun as DRS is enabled. Zhou, Alonso and Sainz all pit.", "2023-08-27T13:18:13Z": "Pit stops for slick tyres now as Hamilton stops for soft rubber!", "2023-08-27T13:17:55Z": "The first 10 laps have flown by! Perez's lead is down to 4.7s on Verstappen and 6s back Zhou is defending third from Gasly.", "2023-08-27T13:17:19Z": "Norris is flying on what has already become a recovery drive. He is among the fastest drivers on the track and is now P11 after passing Lawson.", "2023-08-27T13:16:31Z": "Leclerc is carrying front wing damage from his earlier off track moment, so Ferrari switches his position with Sainz to push the Spanish driver into sixth.", "2023-08-27T13:15:39Z": "Perez might need to get a move on because Verstappen is coming. At the start of lap nine the gap is down to 6.1s.", "2023-08-27T13:14:27Z": "Perez has lapped Sargeant, who is still on soft tyres, and it is only lap seven. What a nightmare for the Williams driver who started 10th.", "2023-08-27T13:14:02Z": "A 10-second penalty for debutant Liam Lawson. The AlphaTauri driver has been sanctioned for 'impeding'.", "2023-08-27T13:13:26Z": "Verstappen makes the same move at Turn 3 a lap later to take second place off Zhou. Now it is a Red Bull 1-2, with Perez leading by 11s.", "2023-08-27T13:12:28Z": "Verstappen shoulders Gasly out of the way on the inside of Turn 3 to take third place. Alonso meanwhile gets by Leclerc for fifth.", "2023-08-27T13:11:15Z": "Given the extreme shuffling in the order, Hamilton is now P19!\u00a0After starting P2 and P3, Norris and Russell are P15 and P12. The rain has worked wonders for some and has been a disaster for others.", "2023-08-27T13:10:47Z": "So, Perez leads by 12s from Zhou on lap five. Gasly is fending off Verstappen for third.", "2023-08-27T13:09:24Z": "All the dry tyres runners have got this wrong and are being eaten up by those who pitted. Norris pits at the end of lap three, but Russell is still going for it.", "2023-08-27T13:09:16Z": "Leclerc goes off onto the gravel. He's on intermediate tyres but there are still some persisting on dry rubber!", "2023-08-27T13:08:00Z": "But it is short lived as Perez leads! He gambled pitting at the end of the first lap and now leads after three and a half laps.", "2023-08-27T13:07:11Z": "Verstappen and Alonso pit at the end of lap two, but Norris and Russell opt to brave it out, as Russell dives up the inside at Turn 1.", "2023-08-27T13:06:59Z": "Perez has already caught the back of the train of cars that had not stopped. This is wonderful chaos!", "2023-08-27T13:06:16Z": "But it's a disaster for Leclerc as Ferrari fail to have his tyres ready on time. He drops to P15!", "2023-08-27T13:05:46Z": "Alonso has got by Norris and into second on lap two! Verstappen still leads.", "2023-08-27T13:05:34Z": "Perez pits as the rain falls. He was P13. Leclerc, Gasly, Tsunoda, Lawson and Magnussen also pit.", "2023-08-27T13:04:57Z": "The rain has arrived at the second half of the opening lap! Wow! It is bucketing down.", "2023-08-27T13:04:51Z": "Hamilton has not had the start he would have wished for and is P14.", "2023-08-27T13:04:20Z": "All well behaved at the start and Alonso goes from fifth to third up the inside of Albon and Russell at Turn 3! What a move!", "2023-08-27T13:02:47Z": "Verstappen lines up on pole position, rain is in the air, everyone on slick tyres. This could be fun.", "2023-08-27T13:01:28Z": "Verstappen leads the formation lap and everyone gets away without a fuss. It is a short lap, so the race start is just moments away.", "2023-08-27T13:00:25Z": "Rain is set to arrive in three minutes according to the FIA but nobody knows how hard. Exciting.", "2023-08-27T12:59:25Z": "Tyre strategy may have been swayed by that threat of rain, given the softs will be able to cope with a little bit of the wet stuff compared to the other dry tyres. So Hamilton going bold, but he has little to lose starting 13th.", "2023-08-27T12:57:48Z": "Starting tyres: Everyone is on softs apart from Hamilton who is on mediums. That was easy.", "2023-08-27T12:56:28Z": "Drops of rain are being reported on the grid... uh oh...", "2023-08-27T12:52:51Z": "The very Dutch pre-race fun is over and it is nearly time for the main event.
