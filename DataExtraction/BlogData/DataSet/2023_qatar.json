Still no sign of Alonso, Albon, Magnussen or the two Alfa Romeo drivers.", "2023-10-07T13:24:14Z": "Russell asks his Mercedes squad if he needs to do a preparation lap or get straight on with it following his out-lap. The reply is the team is still discussing. There's only eight minutes left of the session, not much time to overthink it.", "2023-10-07T13:21:32Z": "The Ferrari pair break the silence as Sainz leads out Leclerc, both on mediums, followed by Perez, Norris and Stroll.", "2023-10-07T13:20:15Z": "With everybody ready, let's begin. Sprint qualifying is go!", "2023-10-07T13:18:18Z": "Anyway, onwards. Sprint qualifying Q1 starts in a couple of minutes and is a 12-minute shootout to knock out the bottom five drivers.", "2023-10-07T13:17:25Z": "One of this year's sprint race format tweaks was to do away with the pointless Saturday practice session, but it came back with a 10-minute vengeance today. Hello, old friend.", "2023-10-07T13:13:12Z": "Verstappen finds just enough time to go off and skip over the gravel at Turn 5 before the end of the session.

Verstappen tops it from Leclerc by nearly two-tenths of a second.", "2023-10-07T13:09:54Z": "Gasly locks up into the Turn 6 hairpin and has to take to the run-off. No problems with the kerbs over there, Pierre, but thanks for checking.", "2023-10-07T13:08:39Z": "Verstappen leads the session with a 1m27.085s, half a second up on nearest challenger Zhou.

But given the track limit detector doesn't kick in until sprint qualifying, it isn't so easy to pick out exactly who hasn't gelled with the track limit changes.", "2023-10-07T13:02:06Z": "Magnussen leads the pack out and the majority of drivers are on a used set of soft tyres. Lap times are largely irrelevant for this session, but it is a kind of non-competitive pre-qualifying.", "2023-10-07T13:00:02Z": "As expected, the entire F1 pack heads out to make the most of this short, sharp session.", "2023-10-07T12:58:29Z": "So, coming up is an unexpected 10-minute blast around the altered Qatar track, then a 10-minute pause before the start of sprint qualifying. After that normal service is resumed.", "2023-10-07T12:55:22Z": "Further rule tweaks could follow for Sunday's race which would prevent a set of tyres being used for more than 20 racing laps.

A 10-minute familiarisation track session will take place now to get the drivers up to speed on the tweaks.", "2023-10-07T12:50:36Z": "Starting at the beginning, naturally, a Pirelli tyre issue was picked up late last night when its engineers inspected the used tyres from Friday. There was sidewall damage to the tyres which was triggered by the new kerbs in Qatar.", "2023-10-07T12:47:54Z": "Hello one and all! Will Verstappen be crowned 2023 F1 world champion today?
