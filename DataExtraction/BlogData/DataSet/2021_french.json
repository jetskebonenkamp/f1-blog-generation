He'll be a way off, but with some much fresher boots.", "2021-06-20T13:40:05Z": "There will be plenty of focus on the drivers who started on the hards now to see how long they can go for and at what pace.

Verstappen was quick on his outlap and managed to slash the disadvantage he had over Hamilton.", "2021-06-20T13:37:41Z": "Hamilton now comes in to make his stop, a tidy stop from Mercedes to get him out on the hards - but Verstappen gets ahead and claims the net lead!", "2021-06-20T13:36:11Z": "All the midfield runners that started on medium tyres have pitted for the hards - except for Norris who is going on a little longer.", "2021-06-20T13:36:01Z": "Red Bull responds and brings in Verstappen - who rejoins just ahead of Bottas to hold position.", "2021-06-20T13:35:10Z": "Bottas rejoins in fourth, and will have a chance to undercut Verstappen now.", "2021-06-20T13:33:53Z": "Gasly does indeed pit, joined by Sainz and Russell, but it is to little effect as Ricciardo storms past to gain track position on the AlphaTauri and Ferrari drivers.", "2021-06-20T13:34:22Z": "Bottas is the first of the front runners to box, collecting fresh hard tyres - and Sainz and Gasly follow him in to also pick up hard tyres.", "2021-06-20T13:30:24Z": "On lap 16 both Tsunoda and Schumacher pit to follow the same strategy as Leclerc - ditching the mediums for hards.", "2021-06-20T13:28:58Z": "Leclerc, another who was really suffering on his mediums and had been overtaken by Ricciardo, pits on lap 15 to ditch those mediums for hards. The Ferrari driver comes out in P19.", "2021-06-20T13:27:56Z": "Bottas had a lock-up at Turn 3, going too deep and snatching at the brakes.", "2021-06-20T13:26:17Z": "And the Aston Martin driver duly gets the move done in good time, under braking at Turn 8, to take 10th place from Alonso.

Bottas is slowly being reeled in by Perez, meanwhile.", "2021-06-20T13:23:50Z": "After a couple of laps of sizing up Alonso, Ricciardo makes his move at Turn 8 to take eighth place, and that invites Norris to join the party as he gets by the Alpine driver between Turns 10-11. Double dose of delight for McLaren.", "2021-06-20T13:22:44Z": "Hamilton reports graining on the front - which you can kind of drive through a bit, as Bottas says he's on top it of at the moment. You can see a little bit of a darker band on the fronts.", "2021-06-20T13:20:10Z": "Stroll is up to 14th place after getting by Raikkonen on the back straight and under braking for the chicane.", "2021-06-20T13:17:26Z": "After his early squabbles with Leclerc, Alonso, in eighth place, is dropping back and coming under pressure from Ricciardo behind him.", "2021-06-20T13:16:16Z": "Bottas is now edging to within DRS range of Verstappen now, having shaved a tenth off Verstappen in each of the last three laps.", "2021-06-20T13:14:45Z": "\u00a0", "2021-06-20T13:14:18Z": "Tsunoda has cleared both Williams and is up to P16, but he may struggle to find further progress so straightforward with Stroll up ahead next.", "2021-06-20T13:14:30Z": "Bottas logs a 1m39.293s for our fastest lap so far, edging closer to Verstappen.", "2021-06-20T13:12:26Z": "Schumacher hasn't made the most of his best F1 starting position as he's now in last place having been overtaken by team-mate Mazepin, who eased him aside and off the track at Turn 4 for good measure.", "2021-06-20T13:13:03Z": "Nice battle shaping up with Gasly and the Ferraris for fifth - all very evenly spaced at the moment.
