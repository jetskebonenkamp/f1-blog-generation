From Hamilton, Alonso and Sainz, but the Ferrari is pushed back to 12th with his penalty.", "2023-04-02T07:35:16Z": "At the crux of the issue for Ferrari is that Sainz will be punished for a restart indiscretion that made no difference to Alonso's finishing position. Stroll will also face no consequence for plunging off-track at Turn 3.", "2023-04-02T07:34:56Z": "The safety car will enter the pits and Verstappen will take the chequered flag, so at least it won't ruin the finish photos.

This will be a spectacle.", "2023-04-02T06:53:07Z": "Piastri looked set for 11th after losing out in his battle with Ocon earlier on. Can this restart give him another chance to score a point at home?", "2023-04-02T06:50:01Z": "The race will restart at 16:56 local time - so in six minutes - just enough time for a quick cuppa.", "2023-04-02T06:49:05Z": "This is reminiscent of the 2021 Azerbaijan GP, when the race was red-flagged late on for Verstappen's tyre failure. There was a two-lap restart then, when Hamilton got Turn 1 all wrong with the 'magic' still on and went off.", "2023-04-02T06:44:32Z": "We can assume everyone will switch to the softs for the final two laps of this race. How the rest plays out is anyone's business.", "2023-04-02T06:43:27Z": "It's not clear from replays whether Magnussen touched the wall exiting Turn 2 which caused the tyre to detach, or whether that was the result. Either way, that could have been a lot worse.", "2023-04-02T06:42:15Z": "Now then! This is about to get really tasty. All the cars will pull into the pits again, be allowed to change tyres, and provide us with two racing laps to the finish.", "2023-04-02T06:41:17Z": "Red flag!", "2023-04-02T06:40:59Z": "So this will bunch the pack up and if we get a late race restart it will be an all-out attack to the finish. At the moment there are three laps to go.", "2023-04-02T06:39:11Z": "More than just a puncture, that's the whole tyre carcass sitting in the road on the approach to Turn 3!", "2023-04-02T06:39:02Z": "A full safety car has been deployed!

Could he deprive Verstappen of a fastest lap point?", "2023-04-02T06:37:27Z": "That slight excursion for Hulkenberg won't have done his tyres any good. But Ocon isn't close enough to pounce for the time being, the Alpine still 3s back.", "2023-04-02T06:36:13Z": "Finally Norris breaches Hulkenberg's defence as he runs ever so slightly wide into Turn 11. The McLaren gets the better exit and ducks up the inside into Turn 12, where Hulkenberg tries to hold him off on the outside before running. into the gravel.", "2023-04-02T06:35:03Z": "Are there enough laps for Perez to get onto the tail of Stroll? He's now within three seconds of the sixth-placed Aston Martin.", "2023-04-02T06:35:00Z": "Hamilton is still keeping Alonso out of his DRS range, while further back Gasly has slipped out of the DRS blanket provided by Sainz.", "2023-04-02T06:33:39Z": "Verstappen makes amends with a new fastest lap of 1m20.342s as he begins to rebuild his lead. It hasn't been a smooth race for the Red Bull despite his dominance.", "2023-04-02T06:33:21Z": "Hulkenberg is doing a great job of defending the inside at Turn 11 from Norris. That's twice in successive laps that the McLaren has come steaming up behind the Haas, only for the 2015 Le Mans winner to repel his advance. Unsurprisingly, Norris has complained over the radio.", "2023-04-02T06:31:08Z": "Verstappen locks up at Turn 13 and goes off track. That gap he built up is cut to 7.6s. Hmmm.", "2023-04-02T06:30:08Z": "Just as Gasly has been doing to good effect, Hukenberg has been able to stave off Norris by keeping within DRS of Perez for the last few laps, but now the Red Bull is pulling clear he may face a sterner test from the McLaren behind.", "2023-04-02T06:29:20Z": "Start the Jaws music, Alonso is upping the pace with a new fastest lap of 1m20.690s. He's 1.1s off Hamilton.", "2023-04-02T06:28:14Z": "Gasly is doing well to piggyback DRS off Sainz to keep him comfortably free from Stroll behind. If he can keep it up until the end of the race, fifth place will be a strong result for Alpine.", "2023-04-02T06:27:36Z": "After his pitstop Sargeant has closed on De Vries, and could soon retake 16th position. Both have now been lapped.", "2023-04-02T06:26:31Z": "Perez wastes no time disposing of Hulkenberg and claims seventh at Turn 11. Through that whole exchange Norris is now much closer to the Haas in their battle over what is now eighth.", "2023-04-02T06:24:58Z": "Wow, an overtake, we almost forgot what one of those looked like.", "2023-04-02T06:24:44Z": "Norris doesn't put up much of a fight as Perez breezes past into Turn 9. Can he use DRS from the Red Bull to close in on Hulkenberg ahead?", "2023-04-02T06:23:18Z": "Ocon is continuing to pull away from Piastri, the gap between 10th and 11th now over 8s. The McLaren driver is in turn over 9s ahead of Magnussen behind so under little immediate threat.", "2023-04-02T06:22:57Z": "Verstappen's next fastest lap, a 1m20.986s, pushes his advantage into double figures at 10.1s on Hamilton. You get the feeling he's got pace in hand if needed.", "2023-04-02T06:21:56Z": "For the first time, Perez is now within a second of Norris ahead. That means DRS, and that has proven a potent weapon in the Mexican's arsenal so far today.", "2023-04-02T06:21:27Z": "If this was a boxing match, this part of the race is the heavy middle rounds when the fighters try to tire each other out and set up a big late knockout.", "2023-04-02T06:19:36Z": "Verstappen regains the fastest lap accolade with a 1m21.319s. But in truth all of the top 10 are lapping within half a second of each other which means one thing: tyre management to get to the end.", "2023-04-02T06:17:29Z": "Magnussen produces a properly late move on Zhou for 12th into Turn 11. That was not an easy DRS breeze-by job - a really committed move from the Haas driver catches Zhou by surprise.", "2023-04-02T06:17:25Z": "Verstappen puts in another fastest lap, only to be beaten seconds later by Hamilton with a 1m24.400s. But there's still 9.2s splitting the pair, as Hamilton is pushing to keep clear of DRS range of Alonso.", "2023-04-02T06:16:37Z": "Unsurprisingly, Sargeant ditches his mediums and takes on a set of hards to go through to the end. De Vries up to 16th, the Williams man down to 17th.", "2023-04-02T06:15:42Z": "Unseen by us, Bottas has cleared Sargeant for 16th, meaning the pair who took mediums for the restart now bring up the rear of the field.", "2023-04-02T06:15:13Z": "Ricciardo is spotted in the Red Bull garage and gets the biggest cheer of the day from the local crowd. He's still #1 to the Aussie fans.", "2023-04-02T06:14:22Z": "All this tyre management is closing the gaps from Hamilton in second all the way back to Perez in ninth. This race has turned into a slower burner after fireworks at the start - almost literally in Russell's case.", "2023-04-02T06:14:09Z": "Zhou becomes the latest driver to pass Tsunoda as the AlphaTauri driver's slow descent down the field continues. No sooner is the move for 12th complete than Magnussen demotes him a further spot into Turn 9.", "2023-04-02T06:12:39Z": "The battle for eighth may soon be about to hot up, as Perez has got the gap down to just 1.5s. He'll soon be within DRS range of Norris.", "2023-04-02T06:11:38Z": "All those laps stuck behind Tsunoda mean Piastri is over 5s down on Ocon. The gap doesn't look like it's coming down for the time being.", "2023-04-02T06:08:22Z": "Perez is chipping away at his deficit to eighth-placed Norris and has got the gap down to 3.6s. But it appears unlikely that he'll be emulating Verstappen's Jeddah recovery to the podium today unless things change significantly.", "2023-04-02T06:06:20Z": "Verstappen sets a new fastest lap of 1m21.772s to pull out another second on Hamilton. The Mercedes driver's race is really against Alonso and Sainz given the Red Bull is in a league of its own.", "2023-04-02T06:06:08Z": "Now finally Piastri gets the move done into Turn 9, easily zooming around the outside of the AlphaTauri. Can the local hero close back up to Ocon in 10th?", "2023-04-02T06:05:14Z": "Piastri must be well and truly sick of studying the rear wing on Tsunoda's car now. They're still locked together, now with Zhou and Magnussen closing behind.", "2023-04-02T06:03:55Z": "Verstappen is turning the screw at the front, as he builds his lead to 6.9s at the end of lap 28.", "2023-04-02T06:03:19Z": "The medium tyre gamble hasn't worked out for de Vries. He's demoted to 17th and last by honorary Aussie Bottas. Ocon meanwhile repeats his move on Piastri to claim 10th from Tsunoda, who didn't put up much resistance.", "2023-04-02T06:02:08Z": "The clean air for Sainz has allowed him to up his pace and he'll aim to join the podium fight over the final third of the race.", "2023-04-02T06:01:47Z": "He's watched Perez do it enough times, now finally Ocon dispatches Piastri around the outside of Turn 9. A good move, rewarding the Alpine man's patience. Will Tsunoda's defences finally be breached too?", "2023-04-02T06:00:46Z": "Hulkenberg has been in a race of his own adrift of the battle behind Gasly and comfortably ahead of Norris since the restart. Will that mean his tyres are in better shape if/when Perez gets onto his tail? The Red Bull hasn't made much inroads on Norris since getting into clear air.", "2023-04-02T06:00:04Z": "Sainz makes his move on Gasly for fourth, sending a dummy to the outside before cutting back to the inside at Turn 3 to charge by at the corner apex. Ole!", "2023-04-02T05:58:49Z": "That's allowing the Gasly-led fight in fourth to close the gap on the podium trio but they will almost certainly be chewing through tyre performance at a greater rate as a result.", "2023-04-02T05:57:43Z": "Another lap, another pass for Perez. This one was rather easier though, taking Tsunoda around the outside well before the braking zone for Turn 9. He's now up to ninth, with Norris his next target.", "2023-04-02T05:57:42Z": "Due to the red-flagged triggered tyre strategy, there's also a fair bit of tyre management going on with the frontrunners. Verstappen is gradually building his lead, up to 4.3s now, while Hamilton has a 2.3s gap over Alonso.", "2023-04-02T05:56:45Z": "The inexorable rise continues. Perez powers around the outside of Piastri into Turn 9 to claim 10th spot. The DRS on that Red Bull is proving powerful once again.", "2023-04-02T05:55:28Z": "Another bold move from Perez at Turn 9 allows him to claim 11th from Ocon. Piastri has a big look at Tsunoda around the outside of Turn 11 but has to fall back into line again. No further action on their contact from earlier is the stewards call.", "2023-04-02T05:54:20Z": "Verstappen's advantage is trimmed to 2.5s but that's more because Hamilton is trying to scamper clear of Alonso behind him, rather than attack for the lead.", "2023-04-02T05:53:01Z": "Russell's exit stage left has promoted Gasly to fourth again but he still has Sainz and Stroll for close company.", "2023-04-02T05:52:51Z": "Since he lost out to Norris, Tsunoda has become a bit of a cork in the bottle. He's holding up Piastri and Ocon behind, allowing Perez a sniff at the Alpine into Turn 11 last time around.", "2023-04-02T05:51:56Z": "Russell's Mercedes is safely cleared away and we have green flag racing once again on lap 20.", "2023-04-02T05:51:26Z": "Russell's car is slow coming through the final sector and then spits fire down the start/finish straight before coming to a safe stop just in front of pit exit.

He's out of the race! The Virtual Safety Car is out.", "2023-04-02T05:48:17Z": "Perez claims another spot into Turn 11, this time at the expense of Zhou on the outside line.
