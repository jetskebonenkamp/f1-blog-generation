Perez is next on his agenda.", "2022-04-24T13:16:37Z": "We'd guess Alonso's damage was picked up in his contact with Schumacher on the opening lap, and then the bodywork on the sidepod gave way just as Hamilton got by him. Alonso pits at the end of lap six and that's his race run.", "2022-04-24T13:15:18Z": "It has been a disaster restart for Alonso who has also lost places to Stroll and Hamilton directly behind him.
