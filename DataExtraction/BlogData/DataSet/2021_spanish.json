Meanwhile, Ricciardo comes in to pit.", "2021-05-09T13:40:19Z": "Hamilton is right on Verstappen's tail now, which arguably forces the Dutchman into pitting. That's not a vintage Red Bull stop at all at 4.2s, and that might help Hamilton massively.", "2021-05-09T13:39:46Z": "Plenty of pitstops for the rest so the running order is cycling through. Raikkonen, as the only driver to start the race on the mediums, is the outlier in the midfield yet to pit.", "2021-05-09T13:39:05Z": "Bottas comes in to stop from fourth place, to rejoin in clean air and try to grab an undercut on Leclerc.", "2021-05-09T13:38:10Z": "It takes a lap for Vettel to get back ahead of Gasly so after being tucked up behind Alonso before the stops he is now around three seconds back.", "2021-05-09T13:36:47Z": "But here's some action as Alonso and Vettel pit together. Alpine win that battle with a stop 1.5s faster than Aston Martin, which costs Vettel as he comes out behind Gasly while Alonso is already attacking Mazepin ahead.", "2021-05-09T13:35:03Z": "Apart from the shuffles at the back of the pack it is as you were in the midfield. That is partly down to strategy and partly down to the nature of the Barcelona track - nobody said overtaking is easy here.", "2021-05-09T13:34:45Z": "Hamilton's asked for some front wing to be taken out to try and reduce the pointiness of the Mercedes and help the tyres out a bit. He's lost a couple of tenths to Verstappen that time around.", "2021-05-09T13:32:17Z": "Gasly pits to serve his penalty and take on fresh mediums. He's back out in P19 but at least that's the dose of pain dealt with for the AlphaTauri team.", "2021-05-09T13:31:27Z": "Hamilton's tyres look pretty beaten-up - a band of wear on the right-rear and a front-left that looks a little frayed too.", "2021-05-09T13:30:31Z": "After losing time through no fault of his own in the pits, Giovinazzi has started his recovery drive by getting ahead of Mazepin. Schumacher is up next but then it is the Williams who pitted with him under the safety car.", "2021-05-09T13:28:21Z": "Leclerc has broken free of Bottas' DRS clutches, so he's got less pressure in third for the time being.", "2021-05-09T13:26:36Z": "Further back Russell and Latifi, both on fresh mediums, have already cleared Schumacher and Mazepin to climb up to P15 and P16 respectively.", "2021-05-09T13:24:57Z": "Gasly will have to serve that penalty when he pits so that'll wreck any early progress he makes in this race. He is currently tucked up behind Vettel in 12th.", "2021-05-09T13:23:29Z": "Hamilton's now trying to get back into DRS range of Verstappen, having just fallen out of the second's range to open up his wing.", "2021-05-09T13:23:00Z": "Gasly has been given a five-second time penalty for starting out of position on the grid. The AlphaTauri driver, who is currently P13, had his front wheels ahead of his grid slot so he's got no defence.", "2021-05-09T13:21:44Z": "Stroll on a roll! At the restart he keeps it pinned around the outside at Turn 4 against Alonso to grab the inside line at Turn 5 and take 10th place.", "2021-05-09T13:21:15Z": "No opportunity for Hamilton to get a run on Verstappen, as the Red Bull broke the tow on that restart.", "2021-05-09T13:20:22Z": "Verstappen pulls the trigger and gets us back underway on Lap 11.", "2021-05-09T13:19:42Z": "Williams also opted to pit both Russell and Latifi under the safety car period.

That means the mechanics have to scramble for a different set and Giovinazzi is stuck stationary waiting to be serviced.", "2021-05-09T13:16:41Z": "Tsunoda's car conks out mid-corner and gives the Japanese driver little option but to pull over.

He can't quite challenge the McLaren at the moment.", "2021-05-09T13:11:05Z": "Bottas has a look at Leclerc into Turn 1 with DRS, but doesn't quite have the minerals to pull off a move on the Ferrari.

It wasn't caught on the TV cameras so we'll need another look at it.", "2021-05-09T13:08:40Z": "Leclerc pulled a cracking move on Bottas, taking the outside line for Turn 3 and edging past the second Mercedes.", "2021-05-09T13:07:29Z": "Verstappen's got a really nice lead out of the box, 1.7s clear of Hamilton as the two have 3s over Leclerc.", "2021-05-09T13:06:50Z": "Further back Mick Schumacher had a super start for Haas getting up to 16th ahead of Tsunoda and Russell.
