We'll be back next week with a live text blog from the Le Mans 24 Hours bringing you all the action from the Centenary edition of sportscar racing's biggest test - see you then!", "2023-06-04T15:04:46Z": "Here's the full report from the 2023 Spanish Grand Prix as Max Verstappen led from lights to flag:\u00a0https://autosport.com/all/news/f1-spanish-gp-verstappen-dominates-from-hamilton-and-russell/10478564/\u00a0", "2023-06-04T15:03:22Z": "It probably won't be remembered as a classic, but the 2023 Spanish GP is in the books and concludes the first European double-header of the season. It's a one week break next (unless you're going to Le Mans, that is) before F1 reconvenes in Montreal, then a relentless run of four races in five weekends in July.", "2023-06-04T14:58:25Z": "He's likely not thinking about it too much at the moment, but only Hamilton and Michael Schumacher have now won more times in Spain than Verstappen. He levels Jackie Stewart, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost and Mika Hakkinen with three.", "2023-06-04T14:53:30Z": "The two points Zhou scores for ninth may not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, but it's only the third time all season that Alfa Romeo has troubled the points scorers and brings it level with Haas in the constructors' standings as each now has 8 apiece.", "2023-06-04T14:50:28Z": "So what's the verdict on the revised Barcelona layout then? Did the faster final corner make for better racing? We'll be sure to find out from the drivers as our team of journalists scour the paddock in the coming hours.", "2023-06-04T14:48:00Z": "After Chelsea footballer Mason Mount handed Verstappen the Pirelli Pole Award yesterday, there's no sign of him on the podium to present the winning prizes as the usual local dignitaries are wheeled out.", "2023-06-04T14:45:59Z": "Elsewhere it was a disappointing day for Norris, who is classified 17th after his lap one tangle with Hamilton wrecked what had until that point looked set to be a promising day. As with Leclerc, a day to forget.", "2023-06-04T14:40:51Z": "Comfortably Mercedes' biggest score this season moves it above Aston Martin to second in the constructors' standings. Despite both cars scoring, its haul of 14 points was the lowest Aston has mustered all season. To put that into perspective, its best haul from last year was 12!", "2023-06-04T14:38:39Z": "Meanwhile it's the first double podium for Mercedes since the team finished 1-2 in Interlagos last year. A positive outcome for its much upgraded car, as this was really the first true test of its capabilities after the outlier that is Monaco.", "2023-06-04T14:38:06Z": "Verstappen also gets the bonus point for fastest lap which extends his championship lead over Perez to 53.", "2023-06-04T14:36:15Z": "Verstappen celebrates win number five of 2023 with his team, which has won all seven rounds of the season so far.", "2023-06-04T14:35:06Z": "One would suspect that Leclerc won't be able to get out of Spain quickly enough, finishing P11.", "2023-06-04T14:34:27Z": "Behind the Aston Martin pair, Ocon, Zhou, and Gasly round out the points-paying positions.

But it's still looking like a fine result for Mercedes to have both cars on the podium, considering Russell started 12th.", "2023-06-04T14:30:15Z": "Leclerc is within half-a-second of Gasly and if he can make the move, due to Tsunoda's penalty, would score a single point for his troubles.", "2023-06-04T14:28:53Z": "Perez is 4s shy of Russell, and it appears too little too late for his podium hopes.", "2023-06-04T14:28:03Z": "True to his word, Alonso hasn't attempted to mount an assault on Stroll for sixth place and has dropped back to almost 2s behind.", "2023-06-04T14:26:50Z": "Tsunoda gets a five-second penalty after his defence against Zhou was deemed to have been beyond acceptability.

Perez has the fastest lap currently, but hasn't the luxury of thinking about saving his tyres for a push to secure the bonus point at the end. Will Verstappen try and nab it from him?", "2023-06-04T14:20:38Z": "Perez has the gap down to 5.7s with eight laps to go. Will he run out of time to catch Russell?", "2023-06-04T14:19:45Z": "Zhou attempts a move around the outside of Turn 1 and complains that he was forced off the track. Ocon will enjoy that relief with some breathing space granted.", "2023-06-04T14:19:18Z": "Stroll is 2s ahead of Alonso in what is shaping up nicely to be an intra-Aston battle for sixth.", "2023-06-04T14:18:28Z": "The closest battle currently in the lower order is between Tsunoda and Zhou for P9 with the pair closing on Ocon ahead. Ocon currently is one-tenth clear of conceding a DRS advantage.", "2023-06-04T14:18:26Z": "Russell's hopes of nabbing second appear forlorn now, as Hamilton has been quicker the last few laps. Can he keep enough life in his tyres now to see off the looming challenge of Perez?", "2023-06-04T14:17:28Z": "Verstappen and Hamilton both set personal bests last time around, one tenth apart. But there's still a full 16s between them.", "2023-06-04T14:15:56Z": "Perez has 8.5s to make up on Russell ahead to get onto the podium. It's a tall ask, but if you'd bank on any car making up that ground it would be a Red Bull. He has the fastest lap of the race currently, a 1m16.666.", "2023-06-04T14:15:05Z": "Change for fourth! Perez was rapidly closing on Sainz with the benefit of his softs, and makes a pass stick into Turn 1. With his hard tyres, Sainz didn't really try and fight that one.", "2023-06-04T14:14:11Z": "In comes Verstappen from the race lead to switch over to softs. Its a routine one.", "2023-06-04T14:13:40Z": "In one lap, Alonso has now pulled two seconds clear of Ocon. Tsunoda is now closing up on the Alpine driver's gearbox.", "2023-06-04T14:12:45Z": "Alonso makes a move stick on Ocon for P7 after the Alpine driver put up a defence that was borderline for acceptability. Ocon forced Alonso into the pit exit with a last-minute move.", "2023-06-04T14:12:19Z": "Russell is just 6s behind Hamilton now those stops have taken place, but it seems fanciful to think he'll usurp his team-mate having taken so much out of his tyres already.", "2023-06-04T14:11:36Z": "Hamilton pits on lap 50 and is followed in by Perez, both taking softs.", "2023-06-04T14:08:57Z": "Now on soft tyres Russell sets two consecutive fastest laps of 1m18.057s, then a 1m17.875s.", "2023-06-04T14:07:28Z": "It's not been the easiest of days for Stroll, but after his second stop he's back up to sixth. However, he can't rest on his laurels with Ocon 3s behind.", "2023-06-04T14:06:39Z": "Another problem for Haas with its rear jack in its latest stop, as Magnussen is the driver hampered this time around.", "2023-06-04T14:06:03Z": "After starting from the pitlane, Leclerc's race has not got much better. He is still P13 and his hopes of a points return looks to be fading.", "2023-06-04T14:05:37Z": "Verstappen has been informed by his team that he's had two track limits warnings. He doesn't need to be pushing too hard now at Turns 5 and 9.", "2023-06-04T14:04:56Z": "Russell now comes in from third and switches back to the soft tyres. He'll try to do the last 20 laps on those.", "2023-06-04T14:04:01Z": "The answer is 'not very much'. Alonso pits on lap 45 for hards and rejoins 10th.", "2023-06-04T14:02:57Z": "Alonso has only used softs in the grand prix so far. How much further will he go before switching to a medium or hard?", "2023-06-04T14:02:19Z": "Verstappen radios in to tell his team he feels the front tyres are overheating. It doesn't seem like that will make much of a difference to the outcome of this race though, somehow, as he's over 16s clear of Hamilton behind.", "2023-06-04T14:01:39Z": "How do Red Bull respond to Sainz's stop? Well, Perez started on mediums and is now on the hard so has his choice of tyre for the final stint. Having yet to use the soft, that's the one you'd bank on him picking, which means he'll want to get closer to the end to make full use of its grip and short shelf life.", "2023-06-04T13:59:50Z": "Sainz now comes in at the end of his 41st lap for a set of hards that will take him to the end. He rejoins sixth behind Alonso.", "2023-06-04T13:58:57Z": "Perez is inching closer to Sainz in fourth. The gap last time around was 3.4s but with the Red Bull driver nine tenths quicker.", "2023-06-04T13:57:45Z": "Piastri stops from P7 as does Gasly, who was one place behind. The pair exit the pits nose-to-tail, just as they had entered it.", "2023-06-04T13:57:46Z": "We've 25 laps to go in the grand prix. Will anybody be able to make an assault on the podium positions? Verstappen, Hamilton and Russell are looking fairly comfortable in their rostrum slots at present.", "2023-06-04T13:56:43Z": "Bottas' defensive plan lasted all of one lap, as Magnussen used DRS to move past the Alfa Romeo.", "2023-06-04T13:55:14Z": "Verstappen's march towards another victory appears unstoppable as he's now 15.3s clear of Hamilton, who has made no inroads despite having the faster tyre.", "2023-06-04T13:54:18Z": "After starting on P3, Norris is currently second-last, is unable to make progress and is about to be lapped by Verstappen. A day of what could have been for the McLaren driver.", "2023-06-04T13:53:35Z": "The second stop for Stroll has brought Alonso back up to sixth as he continues to plug away on the softs.", "2023-06-04T13:53:12Z": "The pit window is reportedly open for those on the hard compound. Given the pit stops have been constant throughout, take that with a pinch of salt.", "2023-06-04T13:51:15Z": "Stroll gives up the unequal struggle on softs and pits from fifth to take on hards, rejoining 13th.", "2023-06-04T13:50:44Z": "No sooner is Russell in DRS range of Sainz than he makes a decisive move to claim third into Turn 1. A bold, late one that won't please the crowds, but an appreciably excellent pass.", "2023-06-04T13:49:26Z": "Perez has good pace on those medium tyres and now gobbles up medium-shod Ocon for sixth into the first corner. Fifth placed Stroll is well within reach ahead on his wilting softs.", "2023-06-04T13:47:41Z": "Sainz isn't able to live with Hamilton's pace either. The Mercedes man was 0.8s faster last time by on lap 32 and has dropped 5.2s back from the seven-time champion in third.", "2023-06-04T13:46:19Z": "False alarm on the rain front. Russell believes it might be sweat inside his helmet that he's mistaken for precipitation as his team confirms nobody else has reported rain.", "2023-06-04T13:45:22Z": "Perez glides through the final corner, activates DRS and buzzes past Alonso along the pit straight. Alonso offered no defence, accepting this was a battle he could not win.", "2023-06-04T13:45:05Z": "Ocon is 2s down on Stroll, and closing by the lap. It looks like that second stint on the softs may be a call Aston comes to regret.", "2023-06-04T13:44:14Z": "Things could get worse for Alonso, with Perez on much fresher tyres now all over his gearbox.", "2023-06-04T13:44:01Z": "At the end of lap 30 Verstappen's advantage stands at 12.6s. Stroll's soft tyres look no match for Russell's fresh mediums and he's already dropped almost 5s behind.", "2023-06-04T13:43:03Z": "While Sainz is keeping the home fans entertained, Alonso's race is so far failing to live up to the highs of his incredible year to date. Chasing his 33rd win, Alonso is P8 and is failing to close the three-second gap to Tsunoda ahead.", "2023-06-04T13:42:41Z": "Verstappen's advantage now stands at 11.9s over Hamilton, and he's not hanging about. His last lap on hards was his best of the race so far, and four tenths faster.", "2023-06-04T13:41:26Z": "Meanwhile Hamilton has taken second from Sainz into Turn 1, with Russell doing likewise on Stroll for fourth.", "2023-06-04T13:40:59Z": "One lap after Verstappen, Perez comes in from second and switches to hards, rejoining ninth.", "2023-06-04T13:40:17Z": "An odd moment in Hulkenberg's latest stop as a change of rear jack was quickly required. The German is now P18, ahead of only Magnussen and Norris.", "2023-06-04T13:40:02Z": "Hamilton is now just 1.2s behind Sainz in the battle for a net second place. Stroll, with soft tyres, has Russell within DRS range and closing in fast behind.", "2023-06-04T13:39:18Z": "Leclerc finally begins to make progress as he passes De Vries for P14. This has not been the afternoon he had hoped for, so far!", "2023-06-04T13:39:12Z": "Verstappen calls time on his mediums and switches to hards after his 26th lap. He rejoins without losing the lead to Perez.", "2023-06-04T13:38:08Z": "One lap after Hamilton, Russell comes in for his own set of mediums. We now have a Red Bull 1-2 with both yet to stop, followed by Sainz, Hamilton, Stroll and Russell.", "2023-06-04T13:37:30Z": "Verstappen, Russell and Perez are now the only drivers who have yet to pit. It's impressive how Russell has kept his softs alive when Leclerc has already ditched a set of hards.", "2023-06-04T13:36:28Z": "Lap 25 and Hamilton is called to pit. He takes on mediums and rejoins fifth, behind Sainz.", "2023-06-04T13:35:18Z": "Norris stops again. After stopping early for damage and fitting the hard tyres, he has now bolted on the medium compound rubber. He wins Pirelli bingo for the day!", "2023-06-04T13:34:34Z": "Verstappen is picking up the pace and posts a new personal best of 1m19.869s, looking comfortable some 10s up the road from Hamilton.", "2023-06-04T13:33:43Z": "Gasly re-takes Leclerc and immediately sets a new fastest lap with a 1:19.437s. Of course, lapping in P15, he would not receive the point for this should he retain the accolade for the duration.", "2023-06-04T13:33:04Z": "Sainz is still first of those who have stopped in fifth, 30s down on Verstappen. He's 9s ahead of Stroll, who had been ahead of Russell prior to his stop.", "2023-06-04T13:31:53Z": "Perez set his best lap of the race so far last time around. He's fourth on the mediums, 24.9s behind team-mate Verstappen who is on the same strategy.", "2023-06-04T13:31:35Z": "Following his stop Gasly is quickly rounded up by Leclerc for P16. It should be noted, the Ferrari driver is currently on soft tyres while Gasly is on mediums.", "2023-06-04T13:30:46Z": "In on lap 20 comes Alonso from fifth, to be fitted with a second set of soft tyres. He'll have to take the medium or hards later on.", "2023-06-04T13:30:28Z": "Zhou's early stop is currently paying dividends with the Alfa Romeo driver now up to P9.", "2023-06-04T13:29:34Z": "Piastri moves past De Vries for P14, using DRS to make his pass into Turn 1.", "2023-06-04T13:28:25Z": "Gasly has moved up to sixth by dint of not stopping but has Sainz right on his tail with a fresh set of mediums.", "2023-06-04T13:27:37Z": "Piastri joins the list of stoppers at the end of lap 18, fitting hard tyres and joining the battle for P13 between De Vries and Magnussen.", "2023-06-04T13:27:10Z": "With the more durable medium rubber Perez has moved up to 1.7s behind Alonso, who currently sits fourth. He's showing no signs of following team-mate Stroll into the pits just yet though.", "2023-06-04T13:26:41Z": "Immediately after, Leclerc is pulled into the pits - at the end of lap 16. He fits a new set of soft tyres and falls back to P18.", "2023-06-04T13:25:43Z": "After Sainz's stop, Leclerc pulls to one side to allow Sainz through into P8.", "2023-06-04T13:25:15Z": "The battle between Zhou and Hulkenberg continues, as the Alfa Romeo driver once again passes the Haas into Turn 1. This DRS fight is one that keeps delivering!", "2023-06-04T13:23:41Z": "Yes is the answer as Stroll comes in to cover Ocon and switches onto hard tyres.", "2023-06-04T13:23:20Z": "Ocon's stop means those around him in the top six will be watching his pace closely, with the desire not to be undercut. Could we see more stops soon among the front runners?", "2023-06-04T13:23:08Z": "After avoiding contact through Turns 1-2, Ocon quickly pulls clear and begins to make use of his fresh medium tyres.", "2023-06-04T13:22:28Z": "As Ocon leaves the pits, he rejoins just ahead of the battle for P14 between Hulkenberg, Zhou and Tsunoda.", "2023-06-04T13:21:24Z": "Stroll has slipped 4s back from Hamilton, and was 0.8s slower last time by. Will Russell be able to pounce soon?", "2023-06-04T13:20:13Z": "Verstappen has lessened his pace slightly out front, having ducked under the 1m20s barrier a few laps ago. He's currently doing mid 1m20s, which suggests he's saving his tyres and content to keep the gap as it is to Sainz, knowing Sainz's tyres will give up the ghost sooner.", "2023-06-04T13:19:53Z": "Yet to stop, Leclerc is now in P11. He is currently 1.8s behind Gasly.", "2023-06-04T13:18:21Z": "Russell takes fifth starting lap 11 with a late lunge inside Ocon at Turn 1. Ocon thought he had that covered, but the closing speed of the Merc was truly impressive there.", "2023-06-04T13:17:42Z": "Continuing to recover from a dreadful start, Gasly passes Magnussen around the outside of Turn 1 for P10.", "2023-06-04T13:17:04Z": "At the end of Lap 9, the midfield begin in earnest to pit to switch off the soft compound tyres.

He drops to P19, ahead only of Norris.", "2023-06-04T13:10:41Z": "Russell has been noted for leaving the track and gaining an advantage at the opening chicane.
