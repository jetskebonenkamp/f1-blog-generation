We'll keep you posted on that one, as Hamilton piles the pressure on Ricciardo.", "2023-10-29T20:12:42Z": "Perez is finally out of the car and the damage looks to be too great to even consider sending the Mexican out to please the fans. A nightmare weekend for the home hero.", "2023-10-29T20:11:51Z": "As we resume racing on lap six, Verstappen has a two-second cushion over Leclerc, with the closest battle in the top six between Ricciardo and Hamilton over fourth.", "2023-10-29T20:10:54Z": "Before the VSC was deployed, Norris made his way past Alonso with DRS into Turn 1.

Although it might come, it would only be to turn this into a glorified test session at absolute best.", "2023-10-29T20:06:46Z": "Verstappen has a 1.6 second lead at the end of lap two. How long will Leclerc keep Sainz bottled up behind him?", "2023-10-29T20:06:27Z": "And there it is, the mechanics stop working on Perez's car, he beats the steering wheel and his retirement from the race on lap one is confirmed.", "2023-10-29T20:06:00Z": "Norris has climbed from his lowly starting position to P16 already, with Alonso losing a position to P14 despite the chaos ahead.", "2023-10-29T20:05:19Z": "Verstappen leads Leclerc, who has a flapping left-front endplate, Sainz and Ricciardo.

He returns to the pits immediately.", "2023-10-29T20:04:36Z": "And we're green in Mexico. It's a poor one for the front row men and Verstappen shoots to the inside of Leclerc, while Perez tries to make it three-wide.

Wherever you're watching from, we hope you enjoy the next 71 laps.", "2023-10-29T19:56:08Z": "For a team like Alfa, does it split strategies in the hope of preserving its spot in the top 10?

Quite why he's playing the Gini Wijnaldum song that used to be chanted on the Kop though, I'm not sure.", "2023-10-29T19:40:53Z": "Alonso was boosted one position after Q2 by Alex Albon having his best lap deleted for a track limits infringement, which saw him tumble back from ninth to 14th. It wasn't what the Williams driver had hoped for after being only bettered by Verstappen in FP1 and FP3, leaving him frustrated at both a penalty call he questioned but also the car's drop-off in pace.", "2023-10-29T19:35:38Z": "Norris has been in superb form of late, having finished on the podium in each of the past four races. But he will really have his work cut out today starting from 17th after a Q1 exit that he took the blame for after failing to get the best out of his tyres on his single soft run.

It was the first real sign that Ricciardo is here to stake a claim for a return to Red Bull's A-team and in a season that has lacked narratives, the replacement for Nyck de Vries has certainly provided one.

Needless to say, no other driver without a title has as many poles.", "2023-10-29T19:22:47Z": "Cars are steadily arriving on the grid, and fresh from taking his helmet off Valtteri Bottas has already got his cool suit on.

The Dutchman's victories in 2017, 2018, 2021 and 2022 have put him above Jim Clark as the most successful driver ever in the Mexican GP (although the Scot's first win in 1962 came in a non-championship race and was shared with Trevor Taylor).", "2023-10-29T19:11:59Z": "The cars are starting to make their way to the grid on their reconnaissance laps.

You won't regret it.", "2023-10-29T19:06:50Z": "Just 0.097s covered the top three on the grid in qualifying yesterday, as Charles Leclerc secured his third pole of the year ahead of team-mate Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen's Red Bull.
