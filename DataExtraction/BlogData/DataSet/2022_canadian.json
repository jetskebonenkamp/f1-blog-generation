Pretty simple pass there for the Dutchman.", "2022-06-19T18:24:56Z": "Albon is making his Williams as wide as possible to keep Bottas behind him in the fight for 10th, which in turn is holding up Leclerc.", "2022-06-19T18:23:39Z": "Sainz's pace has dropped a little bit, having been in Verstappen's ballpark in the 1m17s, but is in the 1m18.3s.

Hard tyres for both drivers.", "2022-06-19T18:14:10Z": "Magnussen pits for a new front wing, and gets new medium tyres as well. That puts him to the back - a shame for the Dane.", "2022-06-19T18:14:06Z": "Leclerc has benefitted from those early pitters to climb to 14th place - make that 13th as Perez is crawling to a halt with an engine issue!", "2022-06-19T18:12:58Z": "After starting with a bit of graining, Sainz is closing Verstappen down a bit now and does a 1m17.974s.
