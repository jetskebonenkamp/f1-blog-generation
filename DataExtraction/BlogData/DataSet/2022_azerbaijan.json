That's three retirements in the race and all Ferrari-powered cars.", "2022-06-12T11:45:44Z": "Or not, as Tsunoda dives by Ocon at Turn 3, just has Hamilton did on the French driver a few laps ago.", "2022-06-12T11:44:58Z": "What is it about Alpine and DRS trains? Ocon, still yet to pit, leads Tsunoda, Vettel and Zhou all following closely but so far cannot find a way through.", "2022-06-12T11:43:15Z": "In the meantime, Norris pits - and Ricciardo is now under heavy attack from Gasly. The Australian holds him off, however, keeping the AlphaTauri at bay.", "2022-06-12T11:42:13Z": "Leclerc's engine has just blown up! The Ferrari kicks out plumes of smoke - and that's the day over!

Alonso, in fifth, has a train of McLarens and Gasly behind him.", "2022-06-12T11:36:48Z": "Magnussen passes Bottas at Turn 1 for the second time in this race. The Dane pitted under the virtual safety car, hence falling behind, and is up to 14th place.", "2022-06-12T11:35:06Z": "Perez now comes into the pits, which moves Leclerc up to second. New hard tyres, but that's a slow stop for the Monaco GP winner - nearly 6s, which brings Russell into play here.", "2022-06-12T11:34:34Z": "Shout out to Zhou who is having a decent race so far.

He's within 12.5s of Perez now.", "2022-06-12T11:29:15Z": "Vettel goes bold into Turn 3 to try to pass Ocon, getting clear of the Alpine into the braking zone, but locks up and has to take to the escape road. That drops the German down to 12th behind Ocon, Hamilton and Tsunoda.", "2022-06-12T11:27:28Z": "Hamilton must be getting tired of how his races keep playing out in 2022. He's lost a place to Vettel in the pitstops and now he's stuck in a DRS train led by an Alpine.", "2022-06-12T11:25:20Z": "Leclerc will have to potentially do 40 laps on these hard tyres, if it's a one-stop. But anything can happen in Baku, so it might be a gamble worth taking.", "2022-06-12T11:24:15Z": "Alonso, Norris and Ricciardo all didn't pit under the virtual safety car so they've been promoted up the order ahead of Gasly who did pit and is now eighth.", "2022-06-12T11:22:59Z": "Russell and Gasly also come in for a stop, taking the cheaper option under a virtual safety car. Hard tyres for all.", "2022-06-12T11:22:34Z": "This virtual safety car has triggered a lot of pitstops, but a slow stop for Hamilton has seen Vettel leapfrog him in the pits.", "2022-06-12T11:21:37Z": "There was an almighty crunch as Sainz tried to take Turn 4. There's a VSC now, as Leclerc pits for hard tyres - but it's moderately slow!", "2022-06-12T11:17:08Z": "Lap 7: Perez is still 2s out in front, as Verstappen's still trying to find a way past Leclerc.

A rare one, but rules are rules, the mechanics need to be clear of the car by that time.", "2022-06-12T11:08:45Z": "A front-left lock for Leclerc at the start too, as Perez was never going give that position up. At the start of lap 3, Perez is almost 2s up the road.", "2022-06-12T11:07:48Z": "Latifi has been given a 10-second stop/go penalty for a stating grid infringement - it was a quick call by the stewards, so must have been clear cut.", "2022-06-12T11:07:06Z": "Perez has already built a pretty big lead over Leclerc, 1.3s over the Monegasque by the end of lap 1. It's as you were in the rest of the top six - Verstappen, Sainz, Russell and Gasly.", "2022-06-12T11:06:55Z": "Magnussen gets back by Stroll to regain 17th place into Turn 1 at the start of the second lap.", "2022-06-12T11:06:15Z": "All very well behaved by the midfield at the start, Vettel gets the jump on Tsunoda to take eighth place, while Albon and Stroll both made up two places further back.", "2022-06-12T11:05:23Z": "Perez gets a great start and dives down the inside of Leclerc to take the lead!
